        <p>Sorting and filtering items in To Do Machine allows the user to organize their list and mark tasks as complete in an efficient and simple manner.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#location">Where Do I Sort and Filter Items?</a></li>
            <li><a href="#sorting">Sorting</a></li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="header" id="location">Where Do I Sort and Filter Items?</h2>
        <p>In the left menu of To Do Machine, there are multiple sections of buttons. The bottom section, labeled, "Sorting and Filtering a List", contains four buttons: "Sort by Date", "Show All Items", "Show Completed Items", and "Show Incomplete Items". Clicking on either of these buttons will either sort the list by date or will show only certain items, filtering them.</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="sorting">Sorting</h3>
        <p>By clicking on the "Sort by Date" button, the table will be sorted in a descending order of date, whereas the item with the earliest date provided will be at the top of the list. For items without a date, they are placed beneath all items with a date, as there are no times for those items to be completed by.</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="filtering">Filtering</h2>
        <p>The list can be filtered by its complete status by using the three buttons beneath the "Sort by Date" button.</p>
        <p class="format">In filtering the list, items that are not shown are not deleted, but rather are hidden from view. Exporting a list with filtered elements will still export them as expected.</p>

        <h3 class="header" id="filterall">Show All Items</h2>
        <p>The button labeled "Show All Items" causes all of the items in the table to appear, meaning any previously filtered items will appear in their previous positions as expected.</p> 

        <h3 class="header" id="filtercomplete">Show Completed Items</h2>
        <p>The button labeled "Show Completed Items" causes all of the incomplete items in the table to be hidden, leaving only the items marked as complete to be modifiable and seen.</p> 

        <h3 class="header" id="filterincomplete">Show Completed Items</h2>
            <p>The button labeled "Show Incomplete Items" causes all of the complete items in the table to be hidden, leaving only the items marked as incomplete to be modifiable and seen.</p>
