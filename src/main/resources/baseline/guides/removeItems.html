        <p>Removing items in To-Do Machine allows the user to delete previously added items in their to-do list.</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="location">Where Do I Remove an Item?</h2>
        <p>In the table housing the items, the user can select items to delete by left-clicking on their row. Clicking a row with the control button held down will allow the user to select multiple items provided control is held for each item clicked. After selection, clicking the menu button titled, "Remove Selected Items" will result in the selected items being deleted.</p>
        <p class="warning">WARNING: A REMOVED ITEM IS DELETED FROM THE LIST PERMANENTLY AND THERE IS NO WAY TO RETRIEVE A DELETED ITEM. PLEASE REMOVE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS WITH CAUTION.</p>

        <h3 class="header" id="reasons">Reasons to Remove an Item</h3>
        <p>While marking an item's checkbox as completed shows the user that the specified item is completed, it does not remove the item from the list entirely, which could contribute to a bloated to-do list. Organizing and cleaning up a to-do list can involve removing old and completed items.</p>

        <h2 class="header" id="clear">Clearing All Items</h2>
        <p style="display: inline">If the user wishes to start a to-do list from scratch or wishes to delete all the items of the list instantaneously, then the menu option "</p><p class="warning" style="display: inline">CLEAR ALL ITEMS</p><p style="display: inline">" is available to press. Upon clicking on the button within the left menu, the user will be shown a dialog box to confirm that they want to delete all items of the list. If "yes" is clicked, all items are promptly removed, and the table is emptied.</p>
        <p class="warning">WARNING: JUST LIKE REMOVING SELECTED ITEMS, CLEARING ALL ITEMS CANNOT BE REVERSED. ALL DATA SHOULD BE EXPORTED BEFORE THIS ACTION.</p>
